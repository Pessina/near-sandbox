This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

Copy the `.env.example` to `.env` and modify accordingly:

    cp .env.example .env

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000/multi-chain](http://localhost:3000/multi-chain) with your browser to see the result.

To create a private key needed for this repo (see `.env` file) please consult the NEAR CLI docs, especially:

## NextJS

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/multi-chain/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
